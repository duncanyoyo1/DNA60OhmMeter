# Ohm Meter
### A 3D Printed Ohm Meter for the DNA60 Chipset from Evolv

This repository will contain the OpenSCAD files as well as STL/AMF exports of the parts needed to actually print the mod yourself.

There are currently 2 OpenSCAD files for the model. One with the DNA60 model and one without. The DNA60 model is large and has many complex polyhedrons which greatly increase compile and render time. I recommend using the file without the DNA60 model. It was only used to aid in the alignment of the model.

My focus was on keeping the number of parts down while keeping the outside of the mod as clean as possible.

Currently you only need to print 3 files.

- [The Main Body](Completed_Files/DNA60_OhmMeter.stl)
- [The Fire Button](Completed_Files/Fire_Button.stl)
- [The Up & Down Buttons](Completed_Files/Up_Down_Buttons.stl)

You will find these files in the [Completed Files](Completed_Files) directory.
