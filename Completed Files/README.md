# Ohm Meter
### A 3D Printed Ohm Meter for the DNA60 Chipset from Evolv

This repository will contain the OpenSCAD files as well as STL/AMF exports of the parts needed to actually print the mod yourself.

My focus was on keeping the number of parts down while keeping the outside of the mod as clean as possible.

Currently you only need to print 3 files.

- [The Main Body](Completed_Files/DNA60_OhmMeter.stl)
- [The Fire Button](Completed_Files/Fire_Button.stl)
- [The Up & Down Buttons](Completed_Files/Up_Down_Buttons.stl)

You will find these files in the [Completed Files](Completed_Files) directory.
